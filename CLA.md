# Algenta Contributor License Agreement — DRAFT, NOT FOR USE UNTIL COUNSEL-REVIEWED

> **This file is a placeholder, not a legal document.** Per the approved plan
> for this repository, Algenta wants a formal CLA (rather than a lightweight
> DCO) so that community SDK contributions can later be folded into other
> Algenta products/editions with maximum flexibility. The text below sketches
> the *shape* of that agreement, modeled loosely on the publicly-available
> structure of the Apache Software Foundation's Individual CLA and Google's
> CLA (both of which Apache's own guidance says are reasonable starting
> points to adapt) — **it is not drafted or reviewed by a lawyer and must not
> be put in front of a real contributor until Algenta's counsel has drafted
> or reviewed the actual text.** Do not wire up a CLA-assistant bot against
> this placeholder in production.

## What the real CLA needs to cover (for counsel's scoping)

- **Grant**: contributor grants Algenta, Inc. a perpetual, worldwide,
  non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable license to reproduce, prepare
  derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and
  distribute the contribution and derivative works, under any license terms
  Algenta chooses — including proprietary/closed licenses for other Algenta
  products or editions, not only the Apache-2.0 terms this repository ships
  under.
- **Patent grant**: a patent license from the contributor for any patent
  claims necessarily infringed by their contribution alone or in combination
  with the project, terminating if the contributor initiates patent
  litigation against Algenta or the project over the contribution.
- **Contributor representations**: the contributor has the right to grant
  this license (either it's their own original work, or their employer has
  authorized it — an employer/Corporate CLA variant may be needed
  separately for contributors submitting on behalf of a company).
- **No warranty**: the contribution is provided "as is," consistent with the
  underlying Apache-2.0 license's own disclaimer.
- **Mechanism**: signed electronically via an automated CLA-assistant-style
  GitHub Action on a contributor's first pull request; the signature record
  should be retained (not just the bot's in-PR comment) in case it's ever
  needed as evidence.

## Scope note for counsel

This repository (`thyn-ai/algenta-sdk`) contains only the Python and
TypeScript client SDKs, licensed Apache-2.0. It does not contain the Algenta
Engine, which is closed-source and lives in a separate private repository.
The CLA's grant should be broad enough to let Algenta relicense or fold
SDK-repo contributions into that closed product line, since that's the
explicit business reason for wanting a CLA over a plain DCO here.
